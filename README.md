This repository will actually serve as an aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.  If you want to draw inspiration from other classmates, feel free to check [this directory of all students!](https://github.com/chssigma/Class_Accounts).

## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```

**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**  

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.

And here is how you should give image credit to someone if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**



## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code Snippets
The goal of the assignment was to get a servo to move 180 in two diffrent directions with a button. I accomplished the goal by working on the button part first so I could get it to work then I did the servo part then added it all togather.

### Reflection
The parts that helped me get though this assignemt was working on one part at a time then put them to gather. This link helped with making the servo work https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-servo. Make sure that you indent your code because it won't work if it's not indented right.

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
Then post an image here.   [Here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## circuitpython_neopixle_with_distancesensor

### Description & Code Snippets
The work you had to do was make a neopixle work with a distancesensor so it would change. Make sure that you try to make all your indents right.


```python
import time
import board
import adafruit_hcsr04  
from rainbowio import colorwheel
import neopixel 
import simpleio

sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D5, echo_pin=board.D6)

pixel_pin = board.NEOPIXEL
num_pixels = 1

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(pixel_pin, num_pixels, brightness=0.3, auto_write=False)

def color_chase(color, wait):
    for i in range(num_pixels):
        pixels[i] = color
        time.sleep(wait)
        pixels.show()
    time.sleep(0.5)


def rainbow_cycle(wait):
    for j in range(255):
        for i in range(num_pixels):
            rc_index = (i * 256 // num_pixels) + j
            pixels[i] = colorwheel(rc_index & 255)
        pixels.show()
        time.sleep(wait)

RED = (255, 0, 0)
YELLOW = (255, 150, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
CYAN = (0, 255, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
PURPLE = (180, 0, 255)

while True:
    try:

        print((sonar.distance,))
        if (sonar.distance <= 5.0):
            blue = 0
            green = 0
            red = 255

        if (sonar.distance >= 5.0) and (sonar.distance < 20.0):
            green = 0
            blue = simpleio.map_range(sonar.distance,5.0,20.0,0.0,255.0)
            red = simpleio.map_range(sonar.distance,5.0,20.0,255.0,0.0)

        if (sonar.distance >= 20) and (sonar.distance <35):
            red = 0
            green = simpleio.map_range(sonar.distance,20.0,35.0,0.0,255.0)
            blue = simpleio.map_range(sonar.distance,20.0,35.0,255.0,0.0)
        if (sonar.distance >=35):
            red = 0
            blue = 0
            green = 255
        print("red =",red," green = ",green," blue = ",blue)    
        pixels[0] = (red,green,blue)
        pixels.show()
    
    except RuntimeError:
        print("Retrying!")

    time.sleep(0.1)

### Reflection
Parts that were hard was finding out how to code the color. The things that helped was the link the teacher gave us which is here. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRzoIejkQqugrDoWHBw14qTI0HifXba92WiyQ24whEnzWcCUaCDYu6ifMQKK5O5Ilkxrd7UKIxPLBCW/pubhtml. Make sure that your if statements make sense and work with what you want it to do.

## circuitpython_motor_contro

### Description & Code Snippets
I had to control a motor with a turner.

```python
import board
import analogio
from digitalio import DigitalInOut
import time 
import pwmio 
turner = analogio.AnalogIn(board.A1)
motor = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D9)

while True:
    print(turner.value) #show value 
    time.sleep(0.25)
    motor.duty_cycle = turner.value 
```

## The Hanger onshape

### Assignment Description
We had to make a hanger part using only drawings but it's a pretty simple part build.

### Reflection
The parts that went wrong was I made it the wrong width so the cut didn't work so make sure you read the drawing right. 


## The swing arm 

### Assignment Description
We had to make a swing arm using only drawings which is harder to do than the hanger part. The part is also more complex to do.

### Reflection
The parts that went wrong was I made it the wrong width so the cut didn't work so make sure you read the drawing right. The work was very hard to do when I haven't done it for a while. Make sure that you make all of your lines defined.
